Student: Elima

1. City Infrastructure Management System- I developed a simulated City Infrastructure Management System. This system employs classes, objects, methods, and data structures to handle various aspects of a city, including buildings, traffic, and events.
2. Python City Planning Simulator- I created a simulated city planning system that incorporates the use of classes, objects, inheritance, and file handling. This system manages various city elements, such as buildings, traffic systems, and public events.
3. City Services Simulation: Python OOP and Modular Design- I developed a simulation of city services, emphasizing the use of class variables and code organization into modules(public_transportation.py and test_transportation.py). The simulation covers services such as public transportation, park management, and city utilities.
